Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery of FastAPI Microservice

In most tribes of Sub-saharan Africa, there is a lot of cultural significance given to the day of the week of which an individual is born. Over the years, even though Sub-saharan countries have recovered from decades of poor record keeping of births and deaths, there are large swathes of the population who do not know the day of the week they were born?

This is a microservice that finds what the day of the week of a date in the past or the future was or will be, respectively.

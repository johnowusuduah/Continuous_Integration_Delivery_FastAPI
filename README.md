# Continuous Integration with Github Actions & Continuous Delivery of FastAPI Microservice with AWS App Runner

In most tribes of Sub-saharan Africa, there is a lot of cultural significance given to the day of the week of which an individual is born. Over the years, even though Sub-saharan countries have recovered from decades of poor record keeping of births and deaths, there are large swathes of the population who do not know the day of the week they were born?

This is a microservice that finds what the day of the week of a date in the past or the future was or will be, respectively.

## Demonstration Video
A succinct demonstration video can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYAXvMSty8)

## Instructions on How to Use Microservice
At the end of the microservice url in the browser, append "/finddayofweek/*date*. Ensure that *date* is in the format DD MM YYYY.

For example:

> 1.0 Say we want to find the day of week that the October 1, 2021 falls on, we first express the date in DD MM YYYY format. That is, **01 10 2021**.

> 2.0 In the url of the microservice: https://d5fpjfe2iv.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/, append the name of the function ie. finddayofweek as below:

>https://d5fpjfe2iv.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/finddayofweek/

3.0 Finally, append the the date in the format DD MM YYYY. Finally, we end up with:

https://d5fpjfe2iv.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/finddayofweek/01%2010%202021 - % represents space.
